Inner ugliness, warped personalities, diminished souls. Making sense of Judgment without God.

<!--more-->

I've never been the religious type. I don't enjoy social gatherings, don't particularly like listening to other people give me a song and dance, and definitely do not like a whole lot of rules that are not exactly 'take it or leave it.' I'm a real stick in the mud! I haven't really tried to find religion, but  plenty of people have helped anyway. Their attempts never did much for me. I only ended up understanding the what of religion -- that is, all the moving parts and the reasons they might make sense -- but the Why has never clicked for me. I believe that requires either some type of personal experience I haven't had or an inclination I lack.
