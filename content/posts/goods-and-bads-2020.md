Things I saw, listened to, read, or otherwise experienced not necessarily from 2020, but in 2020. Some good, some bad.

<!--more-->

It doesn't feel necessary to state what kind of year 2020 has been for most of us. I am fortunate to have avoided the worst aspects of the year, so I won't linger on 2020's general misery except to say that the things I liked this year, and some of what I didn't, have a lot to do with the baseline anxiety, restrictions, and frustrations we've all faced.

To avoid restating previous posts about good things on here, see this post on [Persona 5](https://www.absentmammoth.org/posts/2020/06/08/how-to-see-through-fog-persona-5-royal/) and this post on [Hollywood Handbook](https://www.absentmammoth.org/posts/2020/04/26/how-to-see-through-fog-hollywood-handbook/).

### Good things
#### Assorted music
I did not listen to a ton of music this year, new or old. I am reaching the point where I don't feel connected to what's cool and new anymore. I don't mean I'm incapable of *finding* new things, but what I find no longer gives me much of a spark and I feel cynical about most of what I have encountered. I'm not happy about it, but it's outside the scope of this post. I did hear a few things that have stuck with me, though.

##### [Holy Sons - Level Anything](https://holysons.bandcamp.com/track/level-anything)
When I first heard this, I did not know it is Emil Amos's reworking of a *The Freed Man* era Sebadoh song (an Eric Gaffney track, specifically). Emil adds some extra lines and builds [the original song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA3jAKaTZcc) out more, musically, but his additions aren't out of place. While I like both versions, I am partial to the Holy Sons' take. But, whichever version, you really can't beat it as an isolated, lonely stoner guy number. I hear it as one of the great Fraud Revealer songs, the distance that comes from recognizing someone as something different from how they show themselves to others. Whether it's Emil's lazily sung 'No one's ever looked at you and seen right through, but I can level anything. Oh, a smile fades a lie. Meanwhile I choose to foreknow' or Eric's, of course, lo-fi and smirking version, you're getting quality alienation.

##### [Hum - Inlet](https://humband.bandcamp.com/releases)
Have not liked Hum in the past, despite multiple attempts. A fuzzy guitar post-hardcore band seems about as Me as things get, but *You'd Prefer An Astronaut* just never did it for me. But from the first second of *Inlet*, I was hooked. It sounds A B S O L U T E L Y fantastic loud on headphones. Some albums are good or bad in all situations, no matter how you listen to them, but I could see myself having not loved this if I first heard it on my weak car speakers or at low volume through earbuds (both ways I have since listened to it). Nice speakers or over-ear headphones feel like a must for this, and I really do not mean that in a pretentious kind of way. Whatever way you hear it, if it sounds flat, turn the volume uuuup! Turn it up anyway! It's up there with [Boris's *Flood*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkkMLzda-Y) for me as far as 'guitar music that sounds like water' goes. This kind of music can overstay its welcome. And, on first listen, I did catch myself waiting to be let down by a song that meandered too long or an album that lost pace partway through. But *Inlet's* biggest success, outside of sounding awesome, is that it never gets boring, drags, or blends together. That is almost unheard of on a 55-minute long CD with four songs over eight minutes long. What a marvel!

##### [Roy Montgomery - In Our Own Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHjMRi7lu9s)
Speaking of 'guitar music that sounds like water,' the OG of the style's track 'In Our Own Time' from the album *â€ŒAnd Now The Rain Sounds Like Life Is Falling Down Through It* is wonderful. The rest of the album has its ups and downs, but this song stands out so well with its nod to Julian Cope's weird wise druidic hermit character. 

> You in your own time will come to regard me as someone you sadly must overthrow </br>
> I won't see it coming, but pray that within me the grace will be found and I'll just let go </br>
> Caught in our own time, oh how very different to think of the worlds we all have known </br>
> A conscious collective, somewhat ironic out here in the West where we both have grown</br>
> How strange to stand beside you peering at the stars, arranged without a meaning other than they are</br>

##### [Self Defense Family - Jesus of Nazareth](https://selfdefensefamily.bandcamp.com/album/jesus-of-nazareth)
My favorite Self Defense song in a while, maybe because, despite being officially released this year, it was originally recorded in 2011. Patrick redid his vocals for this release, and they are, at least to my ear, much better than the original's likely were. He's nailed whatever he is doing with his voice lately, and I genuinely love it on their newer stuff even if I find his lyrics now less my speed. If the *Have You Considered Punk Music* LP from 2018 is the dividing line between Patrick Kindlon's two approaches to songwriting, the older style being more abstract and character-driven and the newer style being more obviously autobiographical and sometimes petty, 'Jesus of Nazareth' is a nice missing link with his new voice over old words. It includes his very unique and longstanding beef with The Haters, but in the way he used to be funny about it ('I make people feel things, that's my job, and anger's just another thing'), and goes on as a 10-minute pastiche of early Self Defense Family bits. Sung-yelled paired words like 'Rewards, rewards and setbacks / praise and false praise / Pitfalls, pitfalls and betrayals,' the steely guitars and loud drums from early Self Defense EPs/late era End of a Year material, repetitious instrumental segments pulling more in theory than sound from Lungfish, mantras ('It's fine to fail, Christ failed'), plain fun lines to shout along to ('People I've chosen to surround myself with have proven themselves unreliable shells'), unintelligible samples, all wrapped up in a vehicle of some stubborn interest or unusual perspective -- Jesus of Nazareth himself being the focus of the song, but song Jesus is also not *entirely* separate from at least the public persona of Patrick Kindlon. I don't imagine this makes a great jumping-in point for the band, but it does encapsulate what I love most about them.

As the man says on the Bandcamp: 'This is a wild track for fans of our Grateful-Dead-of-DIY era.' Hey, that's me!

##### [Cruel Hand - Your World Won't Listen](https://cruelhand.bandcamp.com)
Shoulda been the entirety of the soundtrack on the Tony Hawk remasters.

##### [Microphones - Microphones in 2020](https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/microphones-in-2020)
Phil Elverum's 44-minute song about everything. It's about his life, but also... *life*. 

Not much I can say about Phil's songwriting that hasn't been said better by others. I love how the guy uses location and place and the to ground the listener. That was a large part of (early) Mount Eerie. And maybe this only works as well as it does for me because I have been to the places he sings about and have memories of my own there. 

Not to return to Self Defense Family so soon, but *Microphones in 2020* is a complementary perspective to SDF's '[Mary Devoured By Horses](https://bbbrecords.bandcamp.com/track/mary-devoured-by-horses).' These are different ways of wondering about similar things. Patrick talks here about memory, aging, and experience with his typical distance, but what he's working through is much the same as Phil. I really like the songs together as a couple sides of the same coin.
