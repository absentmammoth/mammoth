###### Lookin’ cool, Joker!
*Persona 5 Royal* is the best Japanese roleplaying game that isn’t *Tactics Ogre*.  Recently released as an expanded take on the now few years’ old *Persona 5*, *Royal* furthers the story of a gang of outcast Japanese teens, each wronged in a different way by an adult or society. While ultimately a criticism of Japan, from the Lost Decade to Fukushima to today’s right-wing Abe government, the specifics of what it is condemning — corruption, selfishness, complicity, cruelty, sexism, and mindless obedience — are… well, baby, they’re universal.

#### The very basics

Your guy, the dude you move around the screen and the center of the game’s universe, is Ren Amamiya. You’re a high school student who is sent to live in the attic of an old guy’s small-time Tokyo coffee shop after the up-and-coming politician you stopped from drunkenly assaulting a woman falsely accuses you of mugging him. That’s a mouthful, sure, and it only goes from there. On the way to your first day of class at your new school, you bump into a real creepy gym teacher, Suguru Kamoshida, hitting on a classmate, Ann Takamaki. Just after this, your guy and another new classmate, Ryuji Sakamoto, accidentally fall into Kamoshida’s subconscious — his Palace, where you can see how he really views himself and the rest of the world. Turns out this Kamoshida guy is a real piece of work! Inside his head, you and Ryuji are imprisoned, where you meet Morgana, a talking cat, and a whole lotta monsters. You and Ryuji and Morgana and Ann battle through these monsters to defeat Kamoshida in combat and steal his Treasure, that real life object that started it all! (In Kamoshida’s case, it’s his Olympic medal.) This theft precipitates Kamoshida’s “Change of Heart,” a more or less recurring mechanic for all other main bad guys, wherein he disappears from public life for a little while and then comes back to say, “Damn. That stuff I did? That was awful. And I’m awful. Well! I won’t be so bad now.” 

Things escalate for the next 100 hours of gameplay as your expanding team of pals takes down everyone from a chubby mobster with a somewhat familiar bad haircut to the literal Prime Minister of Japan to, wow, what’s this, all of Japan’s subconscious (kind of)?

I’m not going to describe and narrate every little thing that happens in a 100 hour game (because that is boring, and not a useful way to understand what the game really is), but this is the basic idea: Extreme villains like Kamoshida, an ex-Olympic volleyball champion, become such because they are warped by intense desire, ego, and, heck, sin. With few exceptions, they don’t know this is happening to themselves and, because other adults don’t really care or actively benefit from the evil being done by the villains, no one bothers to stop them. Good guys like your guy and Ryuji and Ann are able to summon entities called Personas once they accept how fucked up everything that’s happened to them is. They use these Personas to battle the literal inner-demons of the bad guys and, because this is kind of like Pokemon, you and your guy can capture and meld the bad guys’ inner-demons into bigger and badder ones. There’s also a whole lotta life simulation going on — between taking down corrupt public figures in Final Fantasy-style dungeons, you spend your time in class, making friends, and working part-time jobs.

Also, for one part, a depressed girl asks you to go inside her own subconscious so that you can kill her PTSD — which she imagines in the form of her mom as a giant, flying, and cruel sphinx.

#### What’s really good

*Bernie Sanders...-san*

It’s easy to get lost in the game’s bright colors and bouncy soundtrack, to say nothing of its melodrama and sometimes iffy English translation! But the core of *Royal* is the tenderness with which it treats youth, trauma, and mental health. Your crew of plucky weirdos grows over the course of the game to include a slice of Japanese youth, from mixed-race model Ann and foulmouthed ruined jock Ryuji to the repressed little sister of a Tokyo public prosecutor Makoto Niijima and orphaned gifted artist Yusuke Kitagawa. Each member of the cast has experienced some form of trauma or suffering, the acceptance of which grants them the power needed to right societal wrongs.

While the game’s plot points and characterizations have origins in Japan — some events in the game, like the abusive high school volleyball coach and Yusuke’s adoptive mentor taking credit for his students’ art, are in reference to real world misdeeds in the country — what it most condemns and wrestles with is universal: the powerful cannot police themselves, complicity is both wrong and necessary for true evil to succeed, and victims will always be denied closure without a gang of scruffy teens out there making adults atone for and confess to the extent of their crimes. (This last part is what makes the game special. The kids never intentionally harm their targets in the real world — not even in a Batman kind of way. The heftiest emotional payoff you feel in defeating the Bad Guy comes not from the turn-based combat in boss fights, but after that, when the Bad Guy gets up on stage and says, “I screwed up when I… I’m sorry. I’m going to stop being bad.”  *Persona* recognizes that what many victims want isn’t a declaration of guilt, but an admission of it.)

My favorite sequence of events in the game, after the aforementioned entrance into a girl’s subconscious to kill her PTSD, is how it handles Japan’s (Western-seeming!) criminal justice system. Your guy’s teammate, Makoto Niijima, is little sister to rising star public prosecutor, Sae Niijima. Each villain’s subconscious imbues their “Palace” with a form to protect their treasure and Sae, with her drive to win at any cost, has her treasure locked up inside a giant casino. The house always wins! In her subconscious, she refuses to meet with you unless you can win improbably huge amounts in games of chance... that she has also rigged against you. The Palace has a straightforward path by elevator to the top, but to actually take that path means your guy must beat her at her own game. At one point, as you are rigging one of her own card tables to win a payout from, you can see several other tables all rigged against other places. It's an unremarked on, but visually clear, representation of how fucked everyone who cannot cheat the system, or doesn't even know that must be done, is. (Spoilers: At the end of the added *Royal* content, Sae Niijima leaves the prosecutor’s office to become a public defender. A bonus: She tells you her source of pride is no longer her job, but the fact that she worked to ensure you and your pals have a bright future.)

#### Contrasts

Much of what makes *Persona* so enjoyable is how different it is from other video games. It's true that the core elements of its actual gameplay -- a collect-'em-all turn-based party lifesim visual novel -- have all been done before. And it's true that, even on its hardest difficulty, it is not a particularly "hard" game. But what makes *P5R* the definitive RPG is what it does not have in common with other games. 

First, it's a treat for all the senses. From the title screen on, everything is alive. Bright, flashing colors... a slick soundtrack... responsive and flashy animations... Anything you can see, hear, or interact with in the game rewards you. A big thing in games now is Attention to Detail -- are the horse testicles realistic, my dude? *Persona 5* doesn't go that route.

![](/img/p5r/2020-06-07-00-14-45.png)

Red Dead 2 is one of the greatest games of all time, but I can count the number of times I've looked at my horse's testicles: 0. When Mara comes on the screen for the first time, though? That'll get a doubletake out of me. (I believe you first see Mara as a persona when you climb the huge stairs out of humanity's subconscious into the sky to kill the God of Control. Just, a lot going on in this game.)

Second, it's that the game largely has a coherent message (at least until it gets into some of the Royal content, at which point things get fuzzier). Big games are like big movies, in that a bazillion people work on them, developers are afraid of controversy, and there is such a human centipede of content creation that any idea they do land on is ungodly watered down. Big games have *a lot* of problems. *Persona* manages to have an opinion, to the point that it beats you over the head with it maybe a few more times than it should. BUT, that is obviously preferable to no opinion or "It's complicated, ya know? Maybe Hitler *did* have some good ideas..." What's particularly interesting to me about *Persona's* opinions ("What if 'might makes right?' is the source of much of the world's suffering?" for example) is the knowledge of who is playing this game.

*Persona 5* is easily an 80 hour long game (if you bother with its lifesim aspects). *Persona 5 Royal*, with its additional content, is another 20 or so, but to get that extra content, you have to play the game all over again. So, while *P5R* is not a hard game, it is for hardcores, in that it is very long by video game standards. Japanese RPGs are notorious for being long games, but they're also known for attracting weird little freak fans. *Persona*-adjacent series *Shin-Megami Tensei's* crossover game with *Fire Emblem*, *Tokyo Mirage Sessions*, [attracted some of these freaks](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/vagina-bones-gamers-video-games-women/) when localization removed "vagina bones" from a character's bikini-area. The audience for JRPGs is often unusually reactionary and awkward. These are people known for, at least in the West, decrying "politics in games." To have a big developer like Atlus come at them not just with Opinions, but allegory like the Ann origin story: When she rejects sports hero gym coach Kamoshida, he attempts to assault her friend and then benches her friend from the volleyball team, at which point her friend tries to commit suicide from the roof of the school. Ann blames herself and, angry that her school has endangered other girls by covering up for Suguru Kamoshida, vows revenge. Grim! It's one of many stories throughout the game highlighting the importance of solidarity over complicity.
