<!--more-->

### Articles
- [From Cancel Culture, With Love](https://web.archive.org/web/20220309141108/https://www.gawker.com/politics/russia-america-cancel-culture)
- [Why is David Leonhardt So Happy?](http://web.archive.org/web/20220324135700/https://newrepublic.com/article/165729/david-leonhardt-happy-review-new-york-times-morning-newsletter)
> He has repeatedly declared the pandemic is in retreat. He has cast doubt on masks. And he has one of the biggest platforms at *The New York Times*.
- [The Joy of Hating Stuff for No Good Reason](http://web.archive.org/web/20211202110125/https://www.gawker.com/culture/the-joy-of-hating-stuff-for-no-good-reason)
  - Revisted this in March.
- [Americans Misestimate Minorities](http://web.archive.org/web/20220402204924/https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/03/15/americans-misestimate-small-subgroups-population)
  - And [an interesting, somehow worse counterpoint](https://twitter.com/jomeomonke/status/1504163874236518410).

### Games
- Finished NG **Elden Ring** and then began a new playthrough.
- Picked up **Horizon's Gate**, a turn-based strategy game where you sail around and trade goods/fight monsters. Really chill.
- Got **Siralim Ultimate** on my phone and have been playing it before bed. A Disgaea-style grindfest.
- Returned to **Timberborn** and played an unhealthy amount of the beaver town-builder toward the start of the month. 


### Music
- [**The Body & OAA - Enemy of Love**](https://thebody.bandcamp.com/album/enemy-of-love)
- **CMAT - If My Wife New I'd Be Dead**
  - Despite a recurring harmony effect I didn't care much for, a fun listen and I got a surprised laugh out of the [out of nowhere line](https://cmatbaby.bandcamp.com/track/i-wanna-be-a-cowboy-baby) "Always the cowboy, never the cow / I hate the way my life turned out."
- [**Dazy - The Crowded Mind**](https://dazysound.bandcamp.com/album/the-crowded-mind), [**Dazy & Militarie Gun - Pressure Cooker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tKdZWK1iAs)
  - Found out about Dazy through the single with Militarie Gun. What fun psych pop songs. The one with Militarie Gun is particularly early '90s Breeders -- *What if we just jammed over the intro to Cannonball*?
- **Drug Church - Hygiene**
  - Really wanted to like this -- but then, maybe the hater in me didn't actually -- and just couldn't get with it. I can't deal with every other song he does now being like "Detective Lieutenant." Will give it another try but beyond his recent fixations, I do miss rougher-voiced old Patrick. *Paul Walker* remains the greatest post-hardcore collection of character studies yet made, so it's not all bad.

- [**Young Guv - III**](https://youngguv.bandcamp.com/album/guv-iii)

> PETE (CONT'D): At Sterling Cooper, we've been pioneering the burgeoning the field of research. And our analysis shows that the health risks associated with your products is not the end of the world. People get in their cars everyday to go to work, and some of them die. Cars are dangerous. There's nothing you can do about it. You still have to get where you're going. Cigarettes are exactly the same. Why don't we simply say, "So what if cigarettes are dangerous?" You're a man. The world is dangerous. Smoke your cigarette-- You still have to get where you're going.

> LEE GARNER JUNIOR: That's very interesting. I mean, if cigarettes were dangerous, that would be interesting.

*You still have to get where you're going.* Yeesh.
