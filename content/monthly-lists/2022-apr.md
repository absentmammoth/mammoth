### Games
- I finally returned to **Divinity Original Sin 2** and just might finish it this time around.
- **Returnal** is different from a lot of what I usually play, but really hits the spot with its whole roguelite uncanny tentacle monsters thing.

### Music
- [Gel - Violent Closure](https://gelhc.bandcamp.com/album/violent-closure)
- [Kurt Vile - (watch my moves)](https://music.apple.com/us/album/watch-my-moves/1607120340)
  - Something about this guy I cannot quite get into. 
- [LURK - Around the Sun](https://lurkusa.bandcamp.com/album/around-the-sun)
  - This recording sounds really cool, a lot of depth to it. The music itself is a catchy take on post-hardcore, maybe a bit mathy, "Top Secret" is a John Reis chorus meets Drug Church. I can't quite place the vocalist, but he has a nice rasp, very familiar, and the whole thing together reminds me maybe a bit of the Snowing guy John Galm's other band, [Slow Warm Death](https://slowwarmdeath.bandcamp.com/album/slow-warm-death-2).
- [Parquet Courts - Sympathy for Life](https://parquetcourts.ffm.to/sympathyforlife.owe)
- [Silverbacks - Archive Material](https://silverbacks.bandcamp.com/album/archive-material)
  - Bit of the Drones' sense of humor, Lou Reed, last song is Screaming Females. Would not have minded if the whole thing was like that song.
- [Spiritualized - Everything Was Beautiful](https://spiritualizedband.bandcamp.com/album/everything-was-beautiful)
- [Superchunk - Wild Loneliness](https://superchunk.bandcamp.com/album/wild-loneliness)
- [Thank - Thoughtless Cruelty](https://thankleeds.bandcamp.com/album/thoughtless-cruelty)
  - I don't know how I feel about quoting dril in a song and not sure this is one I'd just put on, but it succeeds at what it's shooting for (the Fall, mclusky, maybe some the pAper chAse).
- [Viagra Boys - Ain't No Thief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCYBYf62wns)
  - What a great video for a song off the upcoming album. Sebastian Murphy has the most amazing tense, twitchy body language. His movement is always just a bit off. Whether it's a conscious tribute to stimulants, I don't know, but I figure they're involved somehow. The song rules, too, of course.

### Podcasts
- [Know Your Enemy - Red Diaper Baby](https://www.patreon.com/posts/red-diaper-baby-64491715)
  - A conversation about the horrible David Horowitz's autobiography. I like hearing about people who've had dramatic shifts in their world view.
- [Know Your Enemy - The Right Kind of Worker (w/ Gabe Winant)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/right-kind-of-w-65860843)
  - Marxist analysis of The State of Things. One of my favorite things is when someone gives words to something I've *felt* but couldn't put into words (uneducated). I learned so much from this.
