* Hank Ewbank, for the h-card display picture and favicon, as well as for showing me...
* Matthew Butterick's [practicaltypograhy.com](https://www.practicaltypography.com)[^1] 
* âŒƒ click "Inspect Element"
* The [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)
* Countless search results that led to various, occasionally contradictory, guides and examples that sometimes found their way into this site. Thank you random guys on StackExchange and Medium. Many of you don't seem to understand flex containers and confused me
* [IndieWeb.org](https://www.indieweb.org), which contains a significant amount of helpful information re: building your own website beyond just the core IndieWeb standards

[^1]:This site is exactly the kind of thing that I love -- clear, opinionated, and it explains the underlying theory and reasoning behind the topic. While I am an absolute amateur, or less than, it always helps me to have a resource like this to turn to. Even if it's completely wrong, it is at least complete!
