      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.absentmammoth.org&#34;&gt;https://www.absentmammoth.org&lt;/a&gt; began in a much different form all the way back in January. Getting it to where it is today took dozens of hours and occupied most of my free time for several months. Making this website gave me something positive to focus on and has been a sick learning experience. I pushed myself more while working on it than I have with anything else in ages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
