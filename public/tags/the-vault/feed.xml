It's several years old now. Have some mid-late 2000s style music blogging. It's killing me not to edit any of it, but... it's a time capsule. From the vault.&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>Similar to Lungfish, Yo La Tengo is a band with a huge and flawless discography. They've released well over a dozen LPs and probably a bazillion other things over their decades long career in music. They are a band unafraid to experiment with different styles of music and even how they &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/40594-yo-la-tengo-plan-insane-concept-tour/">perform live&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like with Lungfish, I don't know what the consensus &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; Yo La Tengo record is. This series isn't about the &amp;quot;best,&amp;quot; right, but the albums that mean the most to me. That instantly makes Yo La Tengo's &lt;em>Painful&lt;/em> the go-to choice here. &lt;em>Painful&lt;/em> is one of their more consistent -- in overall sound -- records. Others, like &lt;em>I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One&lt;/em>, explore a lot of different styles of music in one place. &lt;em>Painful&lt;/em> is consistent and lets you slip into its world completely. You, as a listener, are allowed to spend 49 minutes in a very predictable, in a good way, atmosphere.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
