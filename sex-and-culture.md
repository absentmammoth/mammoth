I recently read an article called *[Everyone is Beautiful and No One is Horny](https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/)* about sex, sexiness, body image, etc. in the pictures. I don't watch movies and am a few years too young to have absorbed by osmosis the sincere, fun horniness of the past she refers to. Despite that, many points of her piece ring true to me as problems in the broader culture, which I have a better understanding of than film (although maybe only barely). Still, there are a couple things that struck me as maybe not the full picture while reading the article. This is a post about a post.

The gist of her initial argument is this: *Starship Troopers* predicted our current society in many ways, including the fact that, in the future, many of us will have aesthetically perfect bodies yet be completely uninterested in each other sexually, because we are too busy killing foreigners, making Marvel movies, and buying McMansions. Also, there is a threshold somewhere around being really, really, really ridiculously good looking which, when crossed over, just makes a person uncanny.

In other words, this tweet, but for fucking:

The broader societal paranoia around sex today is, well, kids just aren't having enough of any kind of it. This paranoia blames phones, pornography, and, obscenely, Evil Women Who Make Men Afraid of Being Called Rapists. But, this article supposes, what if the problem is a world in decline, where sex isn't portrayed as a fun thing that can be done by anyone, but instead only by sterile gym bodies in PG-13 situations?

The world does suck nowadays, in ways it hasn't before, and it's only going to get worse, which was not guaranteed in the past (well, it was, but that was less of a known fact). The world sucks in ways that are exhausting rather than thrilling, which drain you rather than imbue you with energy to fight against it. In the past, the world sucked in ways that might have actually *encouraged* horniness, but not so today: Everyone just wants to lay in bed, and do nothing.

Her other point, that pop culture hides what "normal" human sexuality looks like, is more interesting to me. When I was a chlid, sex could be at least one of three things:

1) A way to get HIV, then AIDS, then die
2) A funny thing, but not a fun thing, that *definitely* didn't happen between the president and an intern, but maybe it did if you look at all the facts in the right light and, if it did, we should execute one or both of them for it -- unless we shouldn't, because it was an ethically fine purely transactional blowjob that you are allowed to have in private, as a treat
3) A way to have a baby and ruin your life like a total tramp

Some people probably experienced a fourth option, which involved religion and morality in a way I am not able to describe sincerely[^1].

Fast forward to today and sex is not shown as fun, either. It is shown as a grim necessity in the plots of books and movies. In this context, sex is something that happens before or after the important stuff, like a cop killing a guy in a morally ambiguous situation. At least now there's a bit less shame attached, with lip service to values like "diversity" (butt stuff) and "acceptance" (non-monogamy) and "experimentation" (non-monogomous butt stuff). I don't know if *Teen Mom* is even on the air anymore! And that's all great, but the pitch for these things, rather than the acts themselves I assume, still turn sex into this job, this thing you have to show up for, this thing you have to do so that the declining world declines a little slower. Exxxhausting.

Like with a lot of things, I agree the problem -- fascistic, utilitarian sexuality -- exists, but cannot accept the view that things were much better in the past, whether in media or people's private lives. If our only criteria is that Dan Akroyd could get a ghost beej 40 years ago, sure, things were better in the past. But in that same decade, HIV/AIDS was used by the worst people in society to turn sex into something terrifying. Is some fun horniness really going to be able to offset the cultural impact of the Reagan administration allowing millions of people to die of AIDS? That sounds like a bad faith read of the article, and maybe it IS unfair, but we need some sense of reality here: Maybe there was once more awesome horniness in movies. Maybe, at the same time, Indiana Jones was implied to be fucking a kid in those movies. And, look, I'm not here to cancel Indiana Jones! He's not real and I don't think anyone came out of those movies inspired by his relationship with Marion Ravenwood. Still, for all the fun horniness you can shake a stick at, there was a lot of bad stuff going on, too. 

Are people, even generally good people, only shaped by the good and fun horniness they see? Do they benefit more from having fun horniness in 1984, with a hefty serving of Revenge of the Nerds to go with it, than they are hurt by seeing two boring, soulless superheroes fuck in 2021 even as they have access to unfathomable amounts of perfectly consensual and authentic and fun pornography? I don't believe these are our only options, but there's no point in discussing Ancient Fun Horniness without looking at it holistically. 

No reasonable person would dispute that fun horniness is good, and it should be more visible, and people should be able to enjoy it. People should see normal people being flirty and having a good time with each other in ways that aren't even sexually explicit![^2] It's also true that there is a limited amount of space for public horniness, because pop culture is a monolith (though a less impressive one than it once was), and right now hella prominent horniness is fascistic and flat and aesthetically upsetting. What I don't accept is that there was a good time for horniness, that we once had this whole horniness thing figured out and then we threw it away. In the past, maybe horniness was X% more fun. Maybe it wasn't! Today, maybe there are aspects of horniness that actually rock and we don't even know it, because perhaps you can only miss the good horniness when it's gone...

One other point, less related to the piece: Sex in pop culture is bad for all the reasons already covered, and some others, but sex in subculture is fuckin' garbage, too. For example, even though Tumblr has technically banned sexualized nudity, Tumblr kink still exists and filters into my dash sometimes. I would just like to say that as bad as superheroes doing missionary under the weighted blanket they use for their anxiety is, young adults(?) cultivating an identity of "enjoys violent sex" and then locking themselves in it is not much better. These people talk exactly the same, have the exact same preferences, and claim to see sex the exact same way. How's that even possible? This isn't specific to Tumblr, though -- just like oral and anal sex have become more common over time, I'm sure violent roleplay has across the board as well. Standup has gone from ass-fucking jokes to choking during sex jokes, and comedians basically know everything, right? Anyway, I'm not here for a conversation about "safe bdsm" versus "bad bdsm" or why people might engage in either kind. I'm an adult, I'm aware of the distinctions, I accept that the majority of these people are fine (if only to keep myself from going insane), and I know other adults are capable of making these choices for themselves. Playacting violent sex, in alt media or in real life, is not really carefree, natural, fun horniness, either.

While this observation doesn't really involve the horniness article, per se, it's related in that the opposite side of the anodyne, orderly sex coin in media right now is the other type of sexual fascism: domination, exploitation, and control. It is not an original observation to point out that the Nice Fascism shown to us in the form of superheroes, supercops, and flawless bodies is covering up an underbelly of the ugly, gruesome fascism that comes to mind more naturally when we think of "fascism." That is, arguably, the unconscious point of the militaristic Milwaukee Bucks logo: It's so nice that the mechadeer is here to take care of us. Meanwhile, the state security apparatus is [concealing the widespread, disgusting abuse](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/15/1036968966/gymnasts-nassar-fbi-senate-hearing-simone-biles-aly-raisman-wray) of child atheletes to protect one source of the nation's pride: teen girls in swimsuits performing unbelievable acts of athleticism before an audience of creeps and patriots.

This violent, fascistic sex will always have the police state's cover for and encouragement of sexual violence, whether that's Larry Nassar, Jeffrey Epstein, or [the police trainer who says](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/02/14/a-day-with-killology-police-trainer-dave-grossman/) the sex after you (a cop) kill someone is the best of your life.

> In the class recorded for “Do Not Resist,” Grossman at one point tells his students that the sex they have after they kill another human being will be the best sex of their lives. The room chuckles. But he’s clearly serious. “Both partners are very invested in some very intense sex,” he says. “There’s not a whole lot of perks that come with this job. You find one, relax and enjoy it.”

This is sicko Nazi rapist bullshit and society condones it by refusing to sanction the freaks who make it possible. The satirical *Super Troopers* sex found in Marvel movies exists to conceal this, because some number of us couldn't handle the reality of this more sinister sexual fascism and a different group of us might try to end it if we had to think about it. But [maybe not that many of us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas).

Sometimes it feels like people use media like *Super Troopers* to keep their sanity by believing that's all fascism is -- it's stupid, it's absurd, it's inept state violence and fear of the other, but in a silly kind of way. You see it with how some people talk about violent Trump supporters, too. "They're bad, but c'mon, have you seen their sinking boats?" The sinking boats are funny! But focusing on the absurdity and blandness of fascism allows the observer to avoid thinking about what else fascism is doing: The people whose boats are sinking are stealing employees' wages, evicting tenants, beating their wives, and molesting their kids. Allegedy, of course. And, like the unchecked spread of a virus, the longer they get away with their impulses, the likelier it is that some variant form of their collective ids will succeed in doing what has always been under the surface.

The reality of sexual fascism looks way more like *Twin Peaks* than any tepid Marvel sex you can point to. *Twin Peaks* shows a psychotic, successful businessman raping and killing his daughter as the town enables him, also preys on his daughter, or looks the other way.[^3] But fascism is bad for the soul no matter how you slice it, and this isn't a competition. It's just, when we talk about the escapism in Marvel movies and the childlike nature of a lot of pop culture right now, it's important to not be similarly dishonest with ourselves about what these things are hiding. The problem isn't skin deep, as it were. Any piece discussing shallow, lame sex by technically "beautiful" people should make note of what is going on under that surface, lest its observations be their own form of escapism. It is often unfair to criticize a writer for not discussing such and such thing when their writing was about this or that. In this case, though, I see this overfocus on the literal banality of fascism as all too common. At this point, there is basically a genre of "look at these kooky fascists" analysis that, implicitly or otherwise, seeks to redirect its more serious criticism to the Liberal Status Quo. An article like Everyone Is Beautiful and No One is Horny has a great but incomplete analysis.

Finally, it's worth pointing out that graphic sex is actually in pop culture right now. *Game of Thrones* (which is a TV show, yes, but is for the same deadeyed normies as superhero movies), for example, is full of dragons and titties, but also incest and rape. This violence is sometimes shown in service of some point or another, I guess about Power, but it's absolutely just as often unsettling titilation. This is not fun horniness, either, yet it's as much a part of pop culture as anything else and it is excluded from the article. I think that is because there is an obsession some people have right now with pointing out how much shit for babies is out there. (But *compared to what*?) They aren't wrong that there is a lot of shit for babies out there, but these opinions generally ignore the prevalence of gratuitous, fascistic violence in other parts of pop culture. I don't mean the sanitized "nobody really dies violence" of superhero movies. I mean the desensitizing violence in movies and video games that serves only to empower, validate, and recruit for the police state. Again, we see the two sides of fascism: the metaphorical fascist deer logo that is funny to some but a sign of healthy hierarchy and authority to others, and the wanton terror of special ops guys who probably grew up on *Call of Duty* now hunting civilians in Afghanistan. 

[^1]: No idea what's going with Gen Z, but it doesn't seem wrong to attribute some of the millennial sex-having stats to just how much money and time was spent on telling us not to have it. I know multiple people who had abstinence-only educators come to their school, drop a piece of gum on the floor, and pick it up covered in germs to say: "This is you if you let a lot of guys into your holes." 
[^2]: Implicit in the argument about public representation of horniness is that pop culture and media *do* influence our preferences, beliefs, and understanding of the world. This should be kept in mind when people discuss whether art can also do bad things.
[^3]: In fact, on the show, there's a whole crew of these powerful guys abusing girls and young women. But contrast the depiction of sexual assault on *Twin Peaks* with, say, how *True Detective* builds up this cabal of wealthy sex criminals only to show the weird inbred couple in the ring who are, thank God, put out of their misery... by cops. For what it's worth, though, I think I recall an ass-eating scene in *True Detective*, so Disney hasn't totally won yet.
