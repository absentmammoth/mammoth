## Site To Do List

#### For sure:
- [ ] Figure out what is going on with the tag css (text-align/self-justify)
- [ ] Clean up CSS, especially grid and font-related, to reduce redundant/unnecessary lines
  - [x] base scss
  - [x] additional-thanks-to scss
  - [x] media-list scss
- [x] Fix pagination arrows so that the number/word is always in the center of the arrows
- [x] Switch colors over to HSL from hex/rgb. Use [ColorHexa](https://www.colorhexa.com).
  - Done, where it'll be used most
- [x] Add '[How the Web Became Unreadable](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/how-the-web-became-unreadable/)' to credits page.
  - Difference between Butterick's approach of 'adjust at it until it seems right' and 'use a formula because that's right.'
- [x] Change footer/header rulers to a light grey ($grey-3)
  - Made .1rem
- [x] More whitespace between post title and header
- [x] More space between navigation titles
- [x] Fix up font sizes on side pages -- media list archive link, headers, etc.
- [ ] Fix wrapped titles on longer post titles
- [x] Fix tags duplicating 'tags:' for each tag
- [ ] Create some space between post titles and body text for the sake of the tags section

#### Consider:
* Change small-caps weight to 500
* Left justify post titles
