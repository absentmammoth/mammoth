<!-- this all feels very ugly, but it essentially calls up archive.md (in the /content folder), which then links to md files in the /archive folder. i don't think this is how i am 'supposed' to do things, but the hugo docs feel very vague sometimes. this works, so i'm leaving it as it is for now. -->
